# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing Python fundamentals using "Python is easy steps" by Mike McGrath

**Thoughts:** Good start, should finish fundamentals tomorrow Did a bit of coding practises of these basics. Day 0 --> Progress!

### Day 1: January 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued from where I stopped yesterday re:Reviewing Python fundamentals using "Python is easy steps" by Mike McGrath. Also stumbled on Corey Schafer's Youtube channel where he breaks python concepts down in an incredible fashion. Finished conditionals, functions and error handling today.

**Thoughts:Spent >2hrs today instead of 1hr planned but found it enjoyable as I get into harder concepts.


### Day 1: January 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Didn't really want to do anything today but did it anyway! Halfway through "Python is easy steps" by Mike McGrath. difficulty level increasing but mostly stuff I had known before. Enjoyed string manipulation, modules etc. Still making errors in referring to entities with the right name such as methods, functions etc. Good progress though. Looking forward to finishing the book so I can start coding for cloud.

**Thoughts:Spent >3hrs today, need to setup a timer to limit to 1hr, didn't get to work on other stuff on my plate.
