### Day 0: January 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued from where I stopped yesterday re:Reviewing Python fundamentals using "Python is easy steps" by Mike McGrath. Also stumbled on Corey Schafer's Youtube channel where he breaks python concepts down in an incredible fashion. Finished conditionals, functions and error handling today.

**Thoughts:Spent >2hrs today instead of 1hr planned but found it enjoyable as I get into harder concepts.


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
